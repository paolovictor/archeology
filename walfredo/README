Welcome to 2003!

This is a game I've worked on as a second semester project on college. The full team was:

- Dalton Cezane
- Helder Fernando
- Fabricio Gutemberg
- Alvaro Magnum
- Me

I've worked on the game engine and tools, graphics and guided the AI development. It's shock full of "what the hell was I thinking" quirks, but it's a fond memory.

To build and run the game:
   
    ant
    ./run.sh

On the first run, it'll take some seconds to pre-process the levels and animations into serialized Java objects (I told you there were some quirks!). Also, it'll open an itty bitty little windows. Sorry, 800x600 was how I rolled those days.

Ah, and it's all in Portuguese!

The controls are:

- Arrow keys move the character and moves the selector on the main menu
- Z and X jump and attack
- X noves forward on the intro cinematic and starts the game
- ESC skips the intro
